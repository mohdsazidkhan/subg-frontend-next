🕌 Halal Disclaimer – SUBG QUIZ App (With Qur'an & Hadith Evidence)
We at SUBG QUIZ are committed to ensuring that our platform aligns with the ethical and spiritual guidelines of Islamic Shariah, offering educational quizzes in a way that is Halal, transparent, and fair.

✅ Why SUBG QUIZ is Halal According to Islamic Principles:
1. ❌ No Gambling (Maisir)
📖 Allah says in the Qur'an:

"O you who have believed, indeed intoxicants, gambling, sacrificing on stone alters to other than Allah, and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful."
(Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:90)

Our app does not involve any gambling or games of chance.

All quizzes are skill-based, and no random prize draws exist.

2. ✅ Payment Is for a Legitimate Service (Subscription for Content)
📘 Hadith (Sahih al-Bukhari):
“The Prophet ﷺ forbade the selling of what is not in your possession.”
(Bukhari 2087)

Users pay for educational access — levels, chapters, and quizzes.

We provide real, structured value in return — not speculative or deceptive gains.

3. ✅ Rewards Based on Merit and Effort
📖 Qur’an says:
“And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives.”
(Surah An-Najm 53:39)

Prizes (e.g., Level 10 scholarship) are only awarded to top 1–3 users based on:

Quiz performance (score)

Time taken

Number of quizzes played

This reflects Islamic justice — reward for effort, not for chance.

4. ❌ No Gharar (Uncertainty or Deception)
📘 Hadith:
The Prophet ﷺ said:
"Do not sell what you do not have."
(Sunan Abu Dawood 3503 – regarding uncertain transactions)

All subscription plans, access levels, and prize conditions are clearly stated.

No user is misled or unaware of what they’re paying for.

5. ✅ Prize Comes from Platform/Sponsor, Not Other Users
Islam prohibits prize pools funded by losing participants (as in lotteries).

In SUBG QUIZ, rewards are funded by platform revenue or sponsors — not pooled from users' money.

💡 This avoids Maisir (gambling) and ensures the model remains Halal.
